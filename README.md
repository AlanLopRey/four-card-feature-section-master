## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS pre-processor
- [BEM metodology](https://getbem.com/) - Block Element Modifier metodology

### What I learned

I put in practice the positioning with the use of the grid lines, beside that was pretty easy and I like doing this challenge, I also set all the card with a specific width and height

```css
.article {
  width: 22.1875rem;
  height: 15.625rem;
}
.calculator {
  grid-row: 2/4;
  grid-column: 3/4;
}
.karma {
  grid-row: 3/5;
  grid-column: 2/3;
}
.supervisor {
  grid-row: 2/4;
  grid-column: 1/2;
}
.team {
  grid-row: 1/3;
  grid-column: 2/3;
}
```

### Continued development

I felt like i could do a better job without the necessity of put margins and paddings in the cards as well as all the content, maybe I found out a better way in the future, also i think I need to study more CSS cuz I felt with certain lack of knowledge but well I do my best
